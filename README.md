I have the electron code here and the [mass] [length] [time] are correct, the same goes for the upquark and downquark; the [current] is a little tricky
but if the time and mass are right the current is realitive to the system of particles so it involes more then one particle and the flow of the electron
the mass length time and current are the dimensions used in physics that give the values for things like [energy] [capacitance] [inductance] [resistance]
and if we want a complete understading, we can use electronic engineering courses to look at atoms like electronic components
its my Goal to help you do that...
