# Quantum-Computing
perl PDL code to simulate Quantum Computing using a Electron

First we have the electron code so we have a good visual of the Electron
as well as the Mass Length Time and Current, there are 6 superpositions
because of the spin we will use .. 1 0 -1 and [1 and 0 and -1] or -0



1. up and down is 1
2. left to right is 0
3. angled is -1
4. all is unknown or [1 and 0 and -1]; we can use it as -0 

1. first we need the electron code and to look at the different superpositions.
2. so even the unknown is usefull in this sense ...

3. passing the electron through gates we can get the data about the electron.
4. Thinking about how to do this with electronic components 
   we can use Magnetic Resistance to store magnetic data.
   
5. In that sense we have our north south negative and positive electron
6. to use for 1 positive north 0 positive south  -1 negative north -0 negative south
7. The spin here is important North or South and it is magnetic.
8. We have two ways of looking at this, a practical (many electrons view)
   and a single electron view
