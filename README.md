# Quantum-Computing
perl PDL code to simulate Quantum Computing using a Electron

First we have the electron code so we have a good visual of the Electron
as well as the Mass Length Time and Current, there are 6 superpositions
we will be using just three, for our Quantum Computer

1. up and down is 1
2. left to right is 0
3. then there is both 1 and 0

1. first we need the electron code and to look at the different superpositions.
