perl PDL code to simulate Quantum Computing using a Electron

First we have the electron code so we have a good visual of the Electron
as well as the Mass Length Time and Current, there are 6 superpositions
because of the spin we will use .. 1 0 -1 and 1 and zero



1. up and down is 1
2. left to right is 0
3. angled is -1
4. all is unknown or 1 and 0;

1. first we need the electron code and to look at the different superpositions.
